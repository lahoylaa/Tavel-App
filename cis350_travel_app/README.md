# 1 Abstract

Travel and overall tourism today is more popular and possible than ever before. With the overwhelming amount of places 
to go which include countless<br />restaurants, landmarks, and so much more, it can be difficult to plan an itinerary based on your goals on a vacation. Travel Wiki looks to aid in the search<br />for the perfect trip, offering extensive information on attractions close to your destination.

# 2 Introduction

Travel Wiki offers users to sign up to an account to enable the usage of the 'save locations' feature for future reference of spots they may want to visit. The<br />vision of how locations will be stored and retrieved is by using Google Places, an API database system with millions of locations ready for the user to look up.<br />Another feature we hope to implement would allow users to change the radius of their search in order to allow for either condensed or widened areas to<br />search from.
